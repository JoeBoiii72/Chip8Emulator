# Chip8Emulator

This is a CHIP8 virtual machine that allows you to run programs written in CHIP8.


To render graphics on screen i used SDL2, a cross platfom HAL library that gives access to audio, mouse, joystick etc. hardware.


The pixel size can be determined via the command line, aswell as the ROM to be loaded.
